# [](#header-2)About
Saxophonist/improvisor/composer Craig Schenker began his musical career in the experimental music scene in Nashville, TN shortly after finishing a music degree at Shenandoah Conservatory in 2006. His musical journey has found him collaborating in projects covering a broad musical realm ranging from the quiet musings of introspective chamber rock trio Arclyte, to the confrontational punk/jazz of Square People, to minimalist accompaniment for Megan Chu’s dance choreography, to the ambient/drone work of Ancient Ocean, to name only a few. Now living in Brooklyn, NY he is an active member of the instrumental noise rock outfit Drunken Sufis and drone/free jazz trio M/S/T. M/S/T is set to release it’s debut album in the summer of 2018. He is currently working on a new solo saxophone album fusing the uncommon pairing of ambient soundscapes and folk traditions.
