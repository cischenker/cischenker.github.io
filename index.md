# [](#header-2)About
Originally hailing from Richmond, VA Saxophonist/Improvisor/Composer Craig Schenker began his musical career in the experimental music scene in Nashville, TN shortly after finishing a music degree at Shenandoah Conservatory in Winchester, VA in 2006. His musical journey has found him collaborating in projects covering a broad musical realm ranging from the quiet musings of introspective chamber rock trio Arclyte to the confrontational punk/jazz of Square People to minimalist accompaniment for Megan Harrold’s dance choreography to the ambient/drone work of Ancient Ocean to name only a few. Now living in Brooklyn, NY he is an active member of the instrumental noise rock outfit Drunken Sufis and drone/free jazz trio M/S/T. M/S/T is set to release it’s debut album later this year. He is currently hard at work on a new solo saxophone album fusing the unlikely pairing of ambient soundscapes and folk traditions.
